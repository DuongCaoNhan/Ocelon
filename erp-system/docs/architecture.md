## System Overview

The ERP Management System is a cloud-native, microservices-based enterprise resource planning solution designed for scalability, maintainability, and high availability. The system follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and implements a polyglot architecture to leverage the best technologies for specific business domains.

### Key Characteristics
- **Microservices Architecture** - Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Polyglot Programming** - Multiple programming languages optimized for specific domains
- **Cloud-Native** - Designed for Azure cloud platform with containerization
- **Event-Driven** - Asynchronous communication through events and messaging
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Business logic organized around domain boundaries

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each microservice has a single, well-defined business responsibility:
- HR Service: Human resources management
- Inventory Service: Stock and warehouse management
- Accounting Service: Financial operations
- Workflow Service: Business process automation
- Notification Service: Communication and alerts

### 2. Database per Service
Each service owns its data and database schema:
- **SQL Server** for transactional services (HR, Inventory, Accounting, Workflow)
- **MongoDB** for document-based services (Notification)
- No direct database access between services
- Data consistency through eventual consistency patterns

### 3. API-First Design
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- Versioned APIs for backward compatibility
- Consistent API patterns across services
- API Gateway for unified access

### 4. Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks and monitoring
